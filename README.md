# About me 

I like to code, swim and learn about businesses. Currently my interests mainly revolve around various Machine Learning domains, namely vision and embedded ML. At present, I am researching on fairness of compression techniques. 

I'm currently pursuing a major with honours in Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar. 

## Programming Languages and Tools

I primarily work with Python. I use it with fluency for machine learning and data science. I also enjoy studying algorithms in C/C++. Sometimes I use MERN for my projects.
