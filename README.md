# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about various domains of computer science, with curiosity in Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Data Structures, and Algorithms. I'm also enthusiastic about cybersecurity, full stack development, and all things related to technology.

## Highlighted Project

### [Data-Narratives-and-Explorations](https://github.com/Aryan-IIT/Data-Narratives-and-Explorations)

Data narratives offer a structured approach to understanding complex datasets, guiding the exploration process, and communicating insights effectively. In this repository, we delve into various datasets, pose insightful questions, and leverage data analysis techniques to derive meaningful answers. The goal is to create compelling narratives that not only reveal insights but also facilitate understanding and decision-making. Furthermore, the processes used illustrate my fluency in various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more.

## Programming Languages and Tools

I primarily work with Python, utilizing it for various projects in Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and more. Additionally, I'm an intermediate in C++ and JavaScript. My experience extends to both Linux and Windows operating systems.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a major in Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar. Beyond computer science, I enjoy swimming and playing drums.
