# About me! ðŸ‘‹

I like to code, swim and learn about businesses. Currently my interests mainly revolve around various Machine Learning domains, namely vision and embedded ML. At present, I am researching on model compression and fairness. 

I'm currently pursuing a major with honours in Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar. 

## Highlighted Project

### [Data-Narratives-and-Explorations](https://github.com/Aryan-IIT/Data-Narratives-and-Explorations)

Data narratives offer a structured approach to understanding complex datasets, guiding the exploration process, and communicating insights effectively. In this repository, we delve into various datasets, pose insightful questions, and leverage data analysis techniques to derive meaningful answers. The goal is to create compelling narratives that not only reveal insights but also facilitate understanding and decision-making. Furthermore, the processes used illustrate my fluency in various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more.

## Programming Languages and Tools

I primarily work with Python. I use it with fluency for machine learning and data science. I also enjoy studying algorithms in C/C++. Sometimes I use MERN for my projects.
